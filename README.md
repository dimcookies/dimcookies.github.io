# Countdown timer
A countdown timer created by tweeking one found online to accomodate our needs. It was created for a hackathon where a technology debate event took place. A list of topics was selected and two people argued over them within a certain amount of time. The countdown was presented in a screen so that everyone is aware of the time remaining

In case you want to use it, change in the res/configuration.js the duration and the topics list
